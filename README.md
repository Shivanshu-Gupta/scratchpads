# Scratchpads

Create multiple scratchpad files for doodling while you're coding.

This is a fork of [omeryagmurlu/scratchpads](https://github.com/omeryagmurlu/scratchpads) which implemented the functionality to remove a single scratchpad on top of the original repo [buenon/scratchpads](https://github.com/buenon/scratchpads) but never got published to the marketplace as an extension.

## Highlights

* Create multiple scratchpads
* Create scratchpads of different languages and file types
* Enjoy VSCode intellisense in your scratchpads
* Scratchpad are not interfering your project and can be removed at any time

## Features

### Add a new scratchpad

* Run the command `Scratchpads: New scratchpad` from the Command Palette
* Select the desired file type

### Re-open a closed scratchpad file

* Run the command `Scratchpads: Open scratchpad` from the Command Palette
* Select the file you wish to re-open

### Remove a single scratchpad file

* Run the command `Scratchpads: Remove scratchpad` from the Command Palette

### Remove all scratchpad files

**Note**: This loops through all the open tabs and closes the scratchpad ones before deleting the files (might seem weird)*

### Add a new file type to the list

* Run the command `Scratchpads: New scratchpad` from the Command Palette
* Select `Add custom...` from the list
* Enter the file type's name
* enter the file's extension
